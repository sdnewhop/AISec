# AISec - AIFinger 

Internet census of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Frameworks and Applications.   

## Goals 
The goal of this project is to provide tools and results of passive and active fingerprinting of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Frameworks and Applications using a common Threat Intelligence approach and to answer the following questions:

* How to detect AI/ML backed systems in the Internet and Entreprise network? 
* Is AI/ML apps secure at Internet scale? 
* What is AI/ML apps security level in a general sense at the present time? 
* How long does it take to patch vulnerabilities, apply security updates to the ML/AI backed systems  deployed on the Internet?
